# 🎯 READY TO DEPLOY: COMPLETE SETUP

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS CONFIGURED

I've created a complete deployment system for your Digital Dignity visualizations. Here's what's ready:

---

## 🚀 QUICK START (3 Commands)

Open Terminal and run these three commands:

```bash
# 1. Setup (makes scripts executable)
cd /Users/terramater/Desktop/digitaldignity-visualizations
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# 2. Deploy to GitHub
./DEPLOY_NOW.sh

# 3. After Vercel deployment, update PHP site (replace with your URL)
./UPDATE_URLS.sh digitaldignity-visualizations.vercel.app
```

**Between steps 2 and 3:** Deploy on Vercel (takes 5 minutes)
